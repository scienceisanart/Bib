\section{Introduction}
There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here \cite{color_space}, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already happened \cite{color_model}.

\section{Conclusion}
``I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe'' \citep{Colour}
